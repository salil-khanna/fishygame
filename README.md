# Fishy Game
<p>
                    <a href="https://www.crazygames.com/game/fishy" target="_blank"> Based off the popular web game </a> , 
                    Fishy Game was one of the first <strong>partner</strong> assignments that I programmed 
                    for my Fundamentals of Comp. Sci. 2 class, where I was not only able to put my java 
                    coding skills to the test, but also my communication skills. As done in Fundamentals 
                    of Computer Science 1, pair programming aims to teach communication skills as well 
                    as what it is like to code in the real world. The basis of Fishy Game was using an 
                    image library alongside traditional java techniques such as classes and methods. 
                    The goal of fishy game is to become the biggest fish in the pond, done by eating 
                    fish smaller than yours. If you try to eat a fish that is bigger than yours, your 
                    fish will instead be eaten and you will have lost the game.
